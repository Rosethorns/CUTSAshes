Pig $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) has a very high $(l:materials/Carbon)carbon$(/l) content, typically 3.8-4.7%, along with silica and other constituents of dross, which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications. Pig $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) is made by smelting $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) ore into a transportable ingot of impure high $(l:materials/Carbon)carbon$(/l)-content "

The traditional shape of the molds used for pig $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) ingots was a branching structure formed in sand, with many individual ingots at right angles to a central channel or runner, resembling a litter of piglets being suckled by a sow. When the metal had cooled and hardened, the smaller ingots (the pigs) were simply broken from the runner (the sow), hence the name pig $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l). As "
