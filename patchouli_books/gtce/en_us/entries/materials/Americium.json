It is a transuranic member of the actinide series, in the periodic table located under the lanthanide element $(l:materials/Europium)europium$(/l), and thus by analogy was named after the Americas.$(p)Americium was first produced in 1944 by the group of Glenn T.

The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors - one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100 grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber "

Several unusual applications, such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope 242mAm, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer."
