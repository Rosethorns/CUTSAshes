It is used in high-power and high-frequency electronics because of its superior electron velocity with respect to the more common semiconductors $(l:materials/Silicon)silicon$(/l) and $(l:materials/Gallium)gallium$(/l) arsenide.$(p)It is used mainly in HEMT and HBT structures, but also for the fabrication of high "
