It has also been produced artificially, and is often known as green $(l:materials/Gold)gold$(/l). The ancient Greeks called it 'gold' or 'white $(l:materials/Gold)gold$(/l)', as opposed to 'refined $(l:materials/Gold)gold$(/l)'. Its colour ranges from pale to bright yellow, depending on the proportions of $(l:materials/Gold)gold$(/l) and $(l:materials/Silver)silver$(/l).$(p)The $(l:materials/Gold)gold$(/l) content of "

This suggests that one reason for the invention of coinage in that area was to increase the profits from seigniorage by issuing currency with a lower $(l:materials/Gold)gold$(/l) content than the commonly circulating metal."
