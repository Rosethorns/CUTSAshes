It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust.$(p)Pure iron is very rare on the Earth's crust, basically being limited to meteorites. "

Humans started to dominate that process in Eurasia only about 2000 BCE, and iron began to displace $(l:materials/Copper)copper$(/l) alloys for tools and weapons, in some regions, only around 1200 BCE. That event is considered the transition from the $(l:materials/Bronze)Bronze$(/l) Age to the Iron Age. Iron "
