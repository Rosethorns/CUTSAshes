This blackish or brown solid occurs naturally as the mineral $(l:ores/Pyrolusite)pyrolusite$(/l), which is the main ore of $(l:materials/Manganese)manganese$(/l) and a component of $(l:materials/Manganese)manganese$(/l) nodules. The principal use for MnO2 is for dry-cell batteries, such as the alkaline battery and the $(l:materials/Zinc)zinc$(/l)-$(l:materials/Carbon)carbon$(/l) battery. MnO2 is also used as a pigment and as a precursor to other $(l:materials/Manganese)manganese$(/l) compounds, such as KMnO4. It is used as a reagent in "
