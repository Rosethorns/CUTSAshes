      "text": "Naquadria is a highly unstable radioactive isotope of $(l:materials/Naquadah)Naquadah$(/l) which has the potential to be an enormously powerful energy source. Even a small amount is capable of emitting a pulse of energy far greater than that of weapons-grade $(l:materials/Naquadah)Naquadah$(/l). As such, when used as a weapon, it has the potential to be as (if not more) powerful as a $(l:materials/Naquadah)Naquadah$(/l)-enhanced nuclear warhead."
