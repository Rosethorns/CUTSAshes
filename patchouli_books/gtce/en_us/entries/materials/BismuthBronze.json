This $(l:materials/Bronze)bronze$(/l) alloy is very corrosion-resistant, a property which makes it suitable for use in environments such as the ocean. $(l:materials/Bismuth)Bismuth$(/l) bronzes and brasses are more malleable, thermally conductive, and polish better than regular brasses. The most common industrial application of these metals are as "
