      "text": "Antimony is a chemical element with the symbol Sb (from Latin: stibium) and atomic number 51. A lustrous gray metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb2S3). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, often known by the Arabic name, kohl. Metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as $(l:materials/Lead)lead$(/l) upon its discovery. The "

The industrial methods for refining antimony are roasting and reduction with $(l:materials/Carbon)carbon$(/l) or direct reduction of stibnite with $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l)."

Alloys of $(l:materials/Lead)lead$(/l) and $(l:materials/Tin)tin$(/l) with antimony have improved properties for solders, bullets, and plain bearings. Antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine-containing fire retardants found in many commercial and domestic products. An emerging application is the use of antimony in "
