It is a semi-fused mass of $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) with fibrous slag inclusions (up to 2% by weight), which gives it a \"grain\" resembling wood that is visible when it is etched or bent to the point of failure. Wrought $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) is tough, malleable, ductile, corrosion-resistant and easily welded. Before the development of effective methods of "

It was given the name wrought because it was hammered, rolled or otherwise worked while hot enough to expel molten slag. The modern functional equivalent of wrought $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) is mild or low $(l:materials/Carbon)carbon$(/l) $(l:materials/Steel)steel$(/l). Neither wrought $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) nor mild $(l:materials/Steel)steel$(/l) contain enough $(l:materials/Carbon)carbon$(/l) to be hardenable by heating and quenching."

The slag characteristic of wrought $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) is useful in blacksmithing operations and gives the material its peculiar fibrous structure. The non-corrosive slag constituent causes wrought $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) to be resistant to progressive corrosion. Moreover, the presence of slag produces a structure which "

The demand for wrought $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) reached its peak in the 1860s, being in high demand for ironclad warships and railway use. However, as properties such as "
