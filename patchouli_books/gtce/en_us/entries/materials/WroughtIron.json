It is a semi-fused mass of $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) with fibrous slag inclusions (up to 2% by weight), which gives it a \"grain\" resembling wood that is visible when it is etched or bent to the point of failure.

The slag characteristic of wrought $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) is useful in blacksmithing operations and gives the material its peculiar fibrous structure.

The demand for wrought $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l) reached its peak in the 1860s, being in high demand for ironclad warships and railway use. "
