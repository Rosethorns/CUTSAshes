A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the $(l:materials/Platinum)platinum$(/l) group, iridium is the second-densest metal (after $(l:materials/Osmium)osmium$(/l)) with a density of 22.56 g/cm3 as defined by experimental X-ray crystallography. At room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure, iridium has a density of 22.65 g/cm3, 0.04 g/cm3 higher than $(l:materials/Osmium)osmium$(/l) measured the same way. It is "

Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.$(p)Iridium was discovered in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural $(l:materials/Platinum)platinum$(/l). Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess Iris, personification of the rainbow,"
