A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the $(l:materials/Platinum)platinum$(/l) group, iridium is the second-densest metal (after $(l:materials/Osmium)osmium$(/l)) with a density of 22.56 g/cm3 as defined by experimental X-ray crystallography. At room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure, iridium has a density of 22.65 g/cm3, 0.04 g/cm3 higher than $(l:materials/Osmium)osmium$(/l) measured the same way. It is "
