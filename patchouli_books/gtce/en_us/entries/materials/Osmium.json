      "text": "Osmium (from Greek osme, \"smell\") is a chemical element with the symbol Os and atomic number 76. It is a hard, brittle, bluish-white transition metal in the $(l:materials/Platinum)platinum$(/l) group that is found as a trace element in alloys, mostly in $(l:materials/Platinum)platinum$(/l) ores. Osmium is the densest naturally occurring element, with an experimentally measured (using x-ray crystallography) density of 22.59 g/cm3. Manufacturers use its alloys with $(l:materials/Platinum)platinum$(/l), "
