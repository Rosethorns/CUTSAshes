It is nonreactive, partly because of the strength of $(l:materials/Carbon)carbon$(/l)-fluorine bonds, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a lubricant, PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions.
