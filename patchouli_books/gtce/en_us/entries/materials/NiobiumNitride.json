At low temperatures (about 16 K) NbN, $(l:materials/Niobium)niobium$(/l) nitride becomes a superconductor, and is used in detectors for infrared light.$(p)Niobium nitride's main use is as a superconductor. Detectors based on it can detect a single photon in the 1-10 micrometer section of the infrared spectrum, which is important for astronomy and "
