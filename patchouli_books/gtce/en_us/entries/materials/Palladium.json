He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, $(l:materials/Platinum)platinum$(/l), rhodium, ruthenium, $(l:materials/Iridium)iridium$(/l) and $(l:materials/Osmium)osmium$(/l) form a group of elements referred to as the $(l:materials/Platinum)platinum$(/l) group metals ("
