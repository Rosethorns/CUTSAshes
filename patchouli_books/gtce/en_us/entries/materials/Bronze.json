      "text": "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of $(l:materials/Copper)copper$(/l), commonly with about 12-12.5% $(l:materials/Tin)tin$(/l) and often with the addition of other metals (such as $(l:materials/Aluminium)aluminium$(/l), $(l:materials/Manganese)manganese$(/l), $(l:materials/Nickel)nickel$(/l) or $(l:materials/Zinc)zinc$(/l)) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic, phosphorus or $(l:materials/Silicon)silicon$(/l). These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than $(l:materials/Copper)copper$(/l) alone, or have other useful properties, such as stiffness, ductility, or machinability."

The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western Eurasia is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC, and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China; everywhere it gradually spread across regions. The Bronze Age was followed by the $(l:materials/Iron)Iron$(/l) Age starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC, "
