      "text": "Bismuth is a chemical element with the symbol Bi and atomic number 83. It is a pentavalent post-transition metal and one of the pnictogens with chemical properties resembling its lighter homologs arsenic and $(l:materials/Antimony)antimony$(/l). Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as $(l:materials/Lead)lead$(/l). It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly "

Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element, and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.$(p)Bismuth was long considered the element with the highest atomic mass that is stable, but in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay "
