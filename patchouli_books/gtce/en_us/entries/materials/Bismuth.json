It is a pentavalent post-transition metal and one of the pnictogens with chemical properties resembling its lighter homologs arsenic and $(l:materials/Antimony)antimony$(/l). Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as $(l:materials/Lead)lead$(/l). It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but surface oxidation can give "
