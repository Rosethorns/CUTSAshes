      "text": "Constantan is a $(l:materials/Copper)copper$(/l)-$(l:materials/Nickel)nickel$(/l) alloy also known as Eureka, Advance, and Ferry. It usually consists of 55% $(l:materials/Copper)copper$(/l) and 45% $(l:materials/Nickel)nickel$(/l). Its main feature is its low thermal variation of its resistivity, which is constant over a wide range of temperatures. Other alloys with similarly low temperature coefficients are known, such as manganin (Cu86Mn12Ni2)."
