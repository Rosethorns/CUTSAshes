It is only slightly malleable and is a ductile rare-earth metal. Gadolinium reacts with atmospheric oxygen or moisture slowly to form a black coating. Gadolinium below its Curie point of 20 °C (68 °F) is ferromagnetic, with an attraction to a magnetic field higher than that of $(l:materials/Nickel)Nickel$(/l). Above this temperature it is "
