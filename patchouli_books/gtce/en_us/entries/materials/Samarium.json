      "text": "Samarium is a chemical element with the symbol Sm and atomic number 62. It is a moderately hard silvery metal that slowly oxidizes in air. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, samarium usually assumes the oxidation state +3. Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably the monoxide SmO, monochalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as samarium(II) iodide. The last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis. Samarium "

The mineral itself was earlier named after a Russian mine official, Colonel Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets, who thereby became the first person to have a chemical "

Although classified as a rare-earth element, samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is more common than metals such as $(l:materials/Tin)tin$(/l). Samarium occurs with concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including cerite, gadolinite, samarskite, $(l:ores/Monazite)monazite$(/l) and bastnäsite, the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element. These minerals are mostly found in China, the "
