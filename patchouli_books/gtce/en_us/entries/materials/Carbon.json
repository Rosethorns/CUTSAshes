      "text": "Carbon (from Latin: carbo \"coal\") is a chemical element with the symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity."

Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human "

The best known are $(l:materials/Graphite)graphite$(/l), diamond, and amorphous carbon. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, $(l:materials/Graphite)graphite$(/l) is opaque and black while diamond is highly transparent. $(l:materials/Graphite)Graphite$(/l) is soft enough to form a streak on "
