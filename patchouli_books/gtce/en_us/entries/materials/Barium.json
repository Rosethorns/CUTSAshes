Because of its high chemical reactivity, barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern times as baryta, does not occur as a mineral, but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.$(p)The most common naturally occurring minerals of barium "

The name barium originates from the alchemical derivative \"baryta\", from Greek barys, meaning \"heavy.\" Baric is the adjectival form of barium. Barium was identified as a new element in 1774, but not reduced to a metal until 1808 with the advent of electrolysis.$(p)Barium has few industrial "
