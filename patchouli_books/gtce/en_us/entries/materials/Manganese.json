It is not found as a free element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination with $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l). Manganese is a transition metal with important industrial alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels.$(p)Historically, manganese is named for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece, "

By the mid-18th century, Swedish-German chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be $(l:materials/ManganeseDioxide)manganese dioxide$(/l)) contained a new element, but they were unable to isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by reducing the "
