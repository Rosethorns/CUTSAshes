      "text": "Zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol Zr and atomic number 40. The name zirconium is taken from the name of the mineral zircon (the word is related to Persian zargun (zircon;zar-gun, \"gold-like\" or \"as $(l:materials/Gold)gold$(/l)\")), the most important source of zirconium. It is a lustrous, grey-white, strong transition metal that closely resembles hafnium and, to a lesser extent, $(l:materials/Titanium)titanium$(/l). Zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier, "

Zirconium forms a variety of inorganic and organometallic compounds such as zirconium dioxide and zirconocene dichloride, respectively. Five isotopes occur naturally, three of which are stable."
