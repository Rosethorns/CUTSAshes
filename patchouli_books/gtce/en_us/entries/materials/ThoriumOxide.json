Also known as thoria, it is produced mainly as a by-product of lanthanide and uranium production. Thorianite is the name of the mineralogical form of $(l:materials/Thorium)thorium$(/l) dioxide. It is moderately rare and crystallizes in an isometric system. The melting point of $(l:materials/Thorium)thorium$(/l) oxide is 3300 Â°C - the highest of all known oxides. Only a few "
