      "text": "High-strength low-alloy $(l:materials/Steel)steel$(/l) (HSLA) is a type of alloy $(l:materials/Steel)steel$(/l) that provides better mechanical properties or greater resistance to corrosion than $(l:materials/Carbon)carbon$(/l) $(l:materials/Steel)steel$(/l). HSLA steels vary from other steels in that they are not made to meet a specific chemical composition but rather to specific mechanical properties. They have a $(l:materials/Carbon)carbon$(/l) content between 0.05-0.25% to retain formability and weldability. Other alloying elements include up to 2.0% "

Precipitation strengthening plays a minor role, too. Their yield strengths can be anywhere between 250–590 megapascals (36,000–86,000 psi). Because of their higher strength and "
