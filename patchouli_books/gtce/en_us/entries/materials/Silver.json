A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\"native silver\"), as an alloy with $(l:materials/Gold)gold$(/l) and other metals, and in minerals "

Silver metal is used in many bullion coins, sometimes alongside $(l:materials/Gold)gold$(/l): while it is more abundant than $(l:materials/Gold)gold$(/l), it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described "
