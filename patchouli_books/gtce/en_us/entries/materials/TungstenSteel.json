Common alloys have between 2% and 18% $(l:materials/Tungsten)tungsten$(/l) by weight along with small amounts of $(l:materials/Molybdenum)molybdenum$(/l) and $(l:materials/Vanadium)vanadium$(/l) which together create an alloy with exceptional heat, corrosion, and wear resistance. $(l:materials/Tungsten)Tungsten$(/l) is one of the oldest elements "
