The name is from Neo-Latin molybdaenum, from Ancient Greek Μόλυβδος molybdos, meaning $(l:materials/Lead)lead$(/l), since its ores were confused with $(l:materials/Lead)lead$(/l) ores. Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele.

The free element, a silvery metal with a gray cast, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element. It readily forms hard, stable carbides in alloys, and for this reason most of world production of the element (about 80%) is used in $(l:materials/Steel)steel$(/l) "
