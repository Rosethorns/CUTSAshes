      "text": "Kanthal is the trademark for a family of $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l)-chromium-$(l:materials/Aluminium)aluminium$(/l) (FeCrAl) alloys used in a wide range of resistance and high-temperature applications. Kanthal FeCrAl alloys consist of mainly $(l:materials/Iron)iron$(/l), chromium (20-30%) and $(l:materials/Aluminium)aluminium$(/l) (4â€“7.5 %). The first Kanthal FeCrAl alloy was developed by Hans von Kantzow in Hallstahammar, Sweden. The alloys are known for their ability to withstand high temperatures and having intermediate "
