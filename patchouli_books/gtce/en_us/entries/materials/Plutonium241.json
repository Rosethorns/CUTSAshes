      "text": "Plutonium is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with $(l:materials/Carbon)carbon$(/l), halogens, nitrogen, $(l:materials/Silicon)silicon$(/l), and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, "

Since uranium had been named after the planet Uranus and neptunium after the planet Neptune, element 94 was named after Pluto, which at the time was considered to be a planet as well. Wartime secrecy prevented its discovery being announced until 1948. Plutonium is the element with the highest atomic number to "

Plutonium-240 exhibits a high rate of spontaneous fission, raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it.

Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors."
