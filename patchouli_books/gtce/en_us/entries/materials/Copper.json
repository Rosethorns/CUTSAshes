It is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as sterling $(l:materials/Silver)silver$(/l) used in jewelry, $(l:materials/Cupronickel)cupronickel$(/l) used to make "
