It is a substitutional alloy: atoms of the two constituents may replace each other within the same crystal structure. $(l:materials/Bronze)Bronze$(/l) is an alloy also containing $(l:materials/Copper)copper$(/l), but instead of $(l:materials/Zinc)zinc$(/l) it has $(l:materials/Tin)tin$(/l).$(p)Both $(l:materials/Bronze)bronze$(/l) and brass may include small proportions of a range of other elements "
