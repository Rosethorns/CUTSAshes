Unlike the predominant isotope $(l:materials/Uranium)uranium-238$(/l), it is fissile, i.e., it can sustain a fission chain reaction. It is the only fissile isotope that is primordial and found in relatively significant quantities in nature.$(p)Uranium-235 has a half-life of 703.8 million years. It was discovered in 1935 by Arthur Jeffrey Dempster. Its "
