A silvery-white metallic d-block element, it has historically been classified as a rare-earth element, together with $(l:materials/Yttrium)yttrium$(/l) and the lanthanides. It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia.$(p)Scandium is present in most of the deposits of rare-"

Because of the low availability and the difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, applications for scandium were not developed until the 1970s. The positive effects of scandium on $(l:materials/Aluminium)aluminium$(/l) alloys were discovered in the 1970s, and its use in such alloys remains its only major "
