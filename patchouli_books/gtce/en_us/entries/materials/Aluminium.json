      "text": "Aluminium (aluminum in American and Canadian English) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13. It is a silvery-white, soft, non-magnetic and ductile metal in the $(l:materials/Boron)boron$(/l) group. By mass, aluminium makes up about 8% of the Earth's crust; it is the third most abundant element after oxygen and $(l:materials/Silicon)silicon$(/l) and the most abundant metal in the crust, though it is less common in the mantle below. The chief ore of aluminium is "
