This soft, silvery-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12, $(l:materials/Zinc)zinc$(/l) and mercury. Like $(l:materials/Zinc)zinc$(/l), it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11. Cadmium and its congeners in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that "
