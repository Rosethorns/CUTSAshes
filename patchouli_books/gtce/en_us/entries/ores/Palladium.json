      "text": "Palladium is a chemical element with the symbol Pd and atomic number 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston. He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, $(l:materials/Platinum)platinum$(/l), rhodium, ruthenium, $(l:materials/Iridium)iridium$(/l) and $(l:materials/Osmium)osmium$(/l) form a group of elements referred to as the $(l:materials/Platinum)platinum$(/l) group metals (PGMs).

Recycling is also a source, mostly from scrapped catalytic converters. The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable investment interest."
